### Hello world! 👩‍💻


My name is Nicoleta Ungur and I am a programmer. I want to break the myth that programmers are antisocial creatures because personally, I am pretty extroverted (hope my laptop can be included here because I talk to it a lot).
When I am not in front of a computer, I am probably doing something else like reading, cooking, going to the gym.

Passionate about tech, web development, mobile app development, and of course coffee. 

My guilty pleasures: books, cats, music & art 📚🎨

Let's get to know each other.
